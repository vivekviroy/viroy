                            <p><strong>Web Server:</strong> Our clients will get web hosting complimentary with our services/package, only if it is already being stated in the email or final proposal sent to you. Therefore, they don&rsquo;t own it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Content Management System (CMS): </strong>CMS is totally ours and clients don&rsquo;t own it. A web application is the one used to manage the administration of content of your website. Whether it&#39;s about CMS or any other software is owned by Viroy™ Pvt. Ltd. and you can use it as long as you run this website on our server.</p>

                            <p><strong>Database Software:</strong> We at Viroy™ Pvt. Ltd. create our own database such as MySql, and clients do not have any right on the same. Clients only own their website data and content stored in the database if they have written it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Source Code (other custom programming):</strong> This isn&rsquo;t owned by the client. We programmed code according to the language of the Web Server Platform that contains the logic and other connectors to all the other software running on the server. Source code created by our team also communicates with outside integrated system servers and this code. The HTML/CSS/Javascript is generated by the source code for the browser to render to your screen.</p>

                            <p><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> HTML and CSS are the languages that browsers understand and therefore, they both are irreplaceable building blocks and clients own this.

                            <p><strong>Domain Name: </strong>Clients do not own this even if you are a registered domain owner. Domain name registration with a registrar confers only exclusive rights of use till the expiry of the contract and not legal ownership.</p>

                            <p>The Legal Reality of Owning A Website: Legally, clients never own the domain name, web server platform, web platform, language, database software and CMS that is being used to build the website.
